# QNetwork
This project implements a method to perform secure communication using quantum key distribution.
Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.3.
For classical communication tinyIpcLib from fellow student uderos was used (https://github.com/uderos/tinyIpcLib).

## Running examples
To run the exercise submission for the edx course perform the following steps:

- Start SimulaQron as described in the introductions pdf
- Start the ipcServer by opening a terminal in the tinyIpcLib folder and running the command python ipcServer.py
- Open a terminal in the QNetwork folder and run the following commands:
    $ export NETSIM=yourPath/SimulaQron
    $ export PYTHONPATH=yourpath:yourpath/tinyIpcLib:$PYTHONPATH
    $ sh run_exercise.sh

Alice and Bob are sharing 1000 qubits and try to generate a key bit from it. Eve is trying to eavesdrop by simply
measuring the qubit and sending it on to Bob. When n is small it can happen that no eaves dropping is detected,
because it just happened that states altered by Eve didn't end up in the states used for testing.

To run the competition submission perform the following steps:

- Start SimulaQron as described in the introductions pdf
- Start the ipcServer by opening a terminal in the tinyIpcLib folder and running the command python ipcServer.py
- Open a terminal in the QNetwork folder and run the following commands:
    $ export NETSIM=yourPath/SimulaQron
    $ export PYTHONPATH=yourpath:yourpath/tinyIpcLib:$PYTHONPATH
    $ sh run_submission.sh

Alice sends Bob a secure message "Hello, Bob!". First the system shares enough key to encode the message with the one
time pad, using the protocol specified in q_network.cfg. Currently only BB84 could be properly tested because DIQKD
required larger n to work and the setup on which this implementation was tested on was too slow. Currently, the DIQKD
implementation can be considered WIP or beeing in Alpha.
